To Install:

1. Open up the trade spreadsheet you want to use this AddOn for. You must install this for every spreadsheet if you have more than one.

2. Select Tools > Script Editor.

3. Start a Blank Project.

4. Copy the script into the project, overwriting all existing text.

5. Save the project and refresh the original spreadsheet page.



Usage:



Pokemon Sprites

    This function autofills the selected cells to return Pokemon sprites referencing 2 arguments. First, the national dex number. Second, whether or not the sprite should be shiny. If no argument is given for the second, it is assumed to be not shiny. The second argument can be as simple as 1/0, y/n, or a cell with the shiny star sprite vs an empty cell. 



Pokemon Name

    This function autofills selected cells to take a national dex number and return the name of the Pokemon it references.



Pokemon Dex Number

    This function autofills selected cells to take the name of a Pokemon (not case sensitive) and find the national dex number for it. Note: You must spell the name correctly. (Pokemon like Farfetchâ€™d have to be exact.)



Pokeball Sprites

    This menu has a list of Pokeball sprites, and any function will autofill all selected cells with the sprite for the Pokeball. (Listed alphabetically to find them faster.)



Shiny Star Sprite

    This function autofills selected cells with a sprite of the in game red star denoting a Pokemon as shiny. Particularly useful to reference the second argument of the Pokemon Sprites function.



IV Autofill

    This menu of functions autofill IV sets for a certain amount of rows. The columns will start from the leftmost and fill in 6, no matter what was selected. This makes it easy to select a bunch of rows by just the HP column and auto fill them all, and prevents mistakes from selecting too many or too few columns.



Hidden Power Type

    This function was originally written by TobiObito and used with his permission. It has been modified slightly to work better with this AddOn. All credit for the functionality of this calculator goes to him.
    The function itself fills selected cells with a formula that calculates the Hidden Power Type using the 6 IVs as arguments. Since the function only needs to know if the value is even or odd, any number 0-31 or E/O will suffice to complete the argument.



Hatch Thread Link

    This function autofills the selected cells with the basic Hyperlink syntax to link a hatch thread from /r/SVExchange.
